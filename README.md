# Shopping Trends Customer Segmentation

## Overview

XY (is not a real company) is a fashion retail company that is currently facing difficulties in understanding customer shopping patterns and optimizing marketing strategies. At present, marketing efforts are executed broadly without a clear understanding of distinct customer groups.

To address this issue, the company must gain insights into customer shopping behavior and segment them accordingly. This will enable more personalized and effective marketing strategies that can drive revenue growth and increase customer retention.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to segment customers based on their shopping behavior using:

        Customer Segmentation

        Customer Segmentation: Demographic

        Customer Segmentation: Behavioral

This segmentation will help the company to:

        Identify unique customer profiles

        Understand purchasing patterns

        Design targeted marketing strategies

        Improve customer satisfaction and retention

##  Tools & Libraries

        pandas – for data manipulation

        numpy – for numerical operations

        matplotlib & seaborn – for data visualization
